# 📊 Power BI Project: Retail Performance & Profitability Dashboard

## 🧾 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales, profit, and operational efficiency across different regions, products, and customer segments using the popular *Sample Superstore* dataset. Built in Power BI, the dashboard delivers business insights that help decision-makers identify performance gaps, optimize discounts, and improve profitability.

## 🎯 Business Goals

- Understand **regional sales and profit distribution**
- Identify **high- and low-performing states and products**
- Evaluate the **impact of discounts on profitability**
- Examine **customer segments and shipping methods** for margin optimization

## 🗂️ Dashboard Sections

### 1️⃣ Regional Performance
> 📍 *Which regions and states are driving or dragging performance?*

- West region leads in both sales and profit
- Central region lags behind despite reasonable sales
- California and New York are the top profit-generating states

### 2️⃣ Profit Drivers
> 💸 *What’s making money — and what’s not?*

- Technology and Office Supplies show high profit margins (~17%)
- Furniture category is underperforming (2.5% margin)
- High discounts correlate strongly with low or negative profit
- Products like "Tables", "Bookcases", and several electronics are consistent loss-makers

### 3️⃣ Segments & Shipping
> 🚚 *How do customer types and shipping methods impact profit?*

- **Corporate customers** deliver the highest profit (47%)
- **Consumer segment** is the least profitable (21%)
- **Standard Class shipping** drives volume but lowers profitability, especially in the East

## ✅ Key Insights

- 🔴 **Discounting above 30% often results in negative profit**
- 📉 **Several high-sales products are actually loss-making**
- 🛠️ **Operational inefficiencies exist in certain regions and ship modes**
- 🎯 **Refocusing on profitable segments and limiting deep discounts** can improve margins

---

## ✅ Business Recommendations

1. **Reevaluate discount strategies** — Target smarter, margin-based discounting
2. **Phase out or optimize loss-leading products** (e.g., Tables, Bookcases)
3. **Streamline shipping options** in low-profit regions (e.g., reduce Standard Class dependency)
4. **Leverage Corporate & Home Office segments** for higher-margin sales
5. Use this dashboard as a **monthly performance monitor** to track trends and intervene early
